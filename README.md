# MazeRunner
Generate and solve mazes using search algorithms like DFS, BFS, A-Star.
Analyze the results for all the 3 algorithms based on the parameters like - Fringe Size, Length of the path, Number of nodes explored.

Generate mazes that are hard for these algorithms to solve (Comparing the factors - Fringe Size, Length of the path, Number of nodes explored)
